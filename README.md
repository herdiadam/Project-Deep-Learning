Network Attack Classification Using CNN-LSTM Models on the HIKARI-2021 Dataset

Abstractâ€” This research focuses on the classification of network attacks using a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) on the HIKARI-2021 dataset. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, effective detection and classification systems are crucial for enhancing cybersecurity measures. The proposed model leverages CNN's capability to extract spatial features and LSTM's strength in capturing temporal dependencies, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 100% in classifying various types of network attacks. Data preprocessing techniques, including normalization and the application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), were employed to address class imbalance, significantly improving model performance. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score also demonstrated perfect 100% scores across all classes. The findings underscore the potential of deep learning techniques in developing robust cybersecurity solutions, paving the way for future advancements in real-time threat detection systems.
